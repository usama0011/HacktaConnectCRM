          SOPs for Work from Home Agents
        </h2>
        <h4>Performance Impact</h4>
        <p>
          While technical issues are valid reasons for work delays, Agents must
          ensure that their productivity is not consistently affected. The
          manager will assess performance based on the following criteria:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pattern of delays:</strong> Agents with recurring issues
            should be asked to provide additional evidence regarding their work
            delays and will be guided accordingly by managers considering the
            nature of issue. Upon successful identification they will be advised
            to make prior arrangements or if alternative solutions required.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adjustment of deadlines:</strong> If delays due to technical
            issues are affecting the completion of tasks, Respective line
            manager will review timelines and adjust tasks accordingly. In cases
            of frequent issues, Agents may be advised accordingly.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Preventive Measures and Recommendations</h4>
        <p>To reduce the frequency of reported issues:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Backup systems:</strong> Agents must consider having a
            secondary internet connection (e.g., mobile hotspot or alternate
            internet device/service) and an uninterruptible power supply (e.g.,
            UPS) for their equipment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scheduled check-ins:</strong> Agents should conduct periodic
            checks on their internet speed, power sources, and hardware
            functionality to avoid last-minute disruptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>IT Support:</strong> As for the Work from Home staff, the
            company will not provide periodic maintenance or troubleshooting
            support for Agents experiencing consistent hardware issues. Agents
            should be responsible for their resources.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Tasks Completion</h4>
        <p>
          Since there is a proposed plan of work from home Agents in terms of
          successive leads proportions (search/sessions/clicks), distinctive
          irregularities in numbers (tasks) will result in significant financial
          reductions in form of penalties.
        </p>

        <h4>Fair Usage Policy</h4>
        <p>
          Proxy services are provided to facilitate work-related tasks only.
          Agents should use proxies only for legitimate, company-approved
          activities, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Secure access to company resources when working remotely.</li>
          <li>Accessing geo-restricted information relevant to work tasks.</li>
          <li>Browsing work-related websites and content only.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Accountability and Consequences</h4>
        <p>
          If there is a pattern of non-genuine or excessive claims, a review
          meeting will be scheduled with the Agents to discuss the matter.
          Repeated irregularities through the reporting system may result in
          disciplinary actions, such as formal warnings or a performance review
          ending with deductions or termination.
